"""
Recursions are the recipe of |jedi| to conquer Python code. However, someone
must stop recursions going mad. Some settings are here to make |jedi| stop at
the right time. You can read more about them :ref:`here <settings-recursion>`.

Next to the internal ``jedi.inference.cache`` this module also makes |jedi| not
thread-safe, because ``execution_recursion_decorator`` uses class variables to
count the function calls.

.. _settings-recursion:

Settings
~~~~~~~~~~

Recursion settings are important if you don't want extremely
recursive python code to go absolutely crazy.

The default values are based on experiments while completing the |jedi| library
itself (inception!). But I don't think there's any other Python library that
uses recursion in a similarly extreme way. Completion should also be fast and
therefore the quality might not always be maximal.
