    Re-throw uncaught `AttributeError`.

    Usage:  Put ``@rethrow_uncaught`` in front of the function
    which does **not** suppose to raise `AttributeError`.

    AttributeError is easily get caught by `hasattr` and another
    ``except AttributeError`` clause.  This becomes problem when you use
    a lot of "dynamic" attributes (e.g., using ``@property``) because you
    can't distinguish if the property does not exist for real or some code
    inside of the "dynamic" attribute through that error.  In a well
    written code, such error should not exist but getting there is very
    difficult.  This decorator is to help us getting there by changing
    `AttributeError` to `UncaughtAttributeError` to avoid unexpected catch.
    This helps us noticing bugs earlier and facilitates debugging.
